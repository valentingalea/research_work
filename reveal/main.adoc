== Agenda
- Intro to Coding Standards
- Splash Damage approach
- Integration into a team
- Integration across projects


== About
- Splash values *MASTERY* especially in *C++*
- We didn't have an established coding standard
  * some attempts to document it in _wiki's_ 


== Pitfalls
[.step]
- Grow big / Hard to navigate
- Get _out-of-date_ quickly
- In separate location
  * outside production source code
- Only select few modify or improve them
- Nobody has time to read documentation! ðŸ˜›


== Splash Damage approach
[.step]
- Standards are **source code files** ðŸ“‘
  * you can break the build messing with the standard!
- Created and improved through code reviews
- A system for easy _reference_ and _searching_


== The Coding Standard
[.step]
- 2 files
  * `SplashDamageCodingStandard.h`
  * `SplashDamageCodingStandard.cpp`
- Located in the main source code
  * `ue4/Game/Source/Main/...`
- *Open Source*
  * https://github.com/splash-damage/coding-standards

== Usage
Applied via code reviews

== Usage (continued)
Takes the pressure off from feeling judgemental

== Modify and *Improve*
- The standard itself is changed though reviews sent to the whole team
- If enough up-votes â†’ the proposal gets submitted
