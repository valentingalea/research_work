== What are Coding Standards
[quote, Wikipedia]
Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language


== What are Coding Standards (cont.)
Formally adopted coding conventions become _standards_


== Examples


== C++ ISO Standard
image::examples/iso.png[iso, float="right"]

`-` actual spec +
`-` promotes specific styles +
ex: all `std::` types / functions are _snake_case_


== C++ Core Guidelines

== Enforcing / Adoption
[.step]
- Normally presented as standalone documentation
  * ex: PDF, wiki's, etc
- People are supposed to study then apply in practice
- Usually _not_ machine readable
  * somewhat exception: Visual Studio _Core Guidelines_ checker


== Pitfalls
[.step]
- Grow big / Hard to navigate
- Get _out-of-date_ quickly
- In separate location
  * outside production source code
- Only select few modify or improve them
- Nobody has time to read documentation! ðŸ˜›


== Splash Damage approach
[.step]
- Standards are **source code files** ðŸ“‘
  * you can break the build messing with the standard!
- Created and improved through code reviews
- A system for easy _reference_ and _searching_


[%notitle]
== Search

== The Coding Standard
[.step]
- 2 files
  * `SplashDamageCodingStandard.h`
  * `SplashDamageCodingStandard.cpp`
- Located in the main source code
  * `ue4/Game/Source/Main/...`
- *Open Source*
  * https://github.com/splash-damage/coding-standards

== Usage
Applied via code reviews

== Usage (continued)
Takes the pressure off from feeling judgemental

== Modify and *Improve*
- The standard itself is changed though reviews sent to the whole team
- If enough up-votes â†’ the proposal gets submitted


== Sections Walkthrough
[.step]
- More architectural than strict rule-sets
- Mostly *Unreal Engine 4* focused rather than `std::`
- Try to cater to all experience levels
  * from _Juniors_ to _Principals_

== Automation
[%step]
- Layout style can be enforced with tools
- We do offer `clang-format` support
- We don't enforce it
  * prefer to use as teaching material

== Adoption
[.step]
- *Splash Damage* has multiple projects ongoing
- Originally standard was created in one project
  * really took off
  * people embraced the idea & spirit
- How to distribute to all?


== Obstacles
[.step]
- Each project is unique in challenges
- Differences across:
- -> Version of UE4
- -> servers and repositories
- -> contracts and legal


== Solution
[.step]
- Move to 'outside' -> GitHub
- Open Source under permissive licence
  * BSD 3-clause
- Small core of maintainers across projects
  * image:sd-team.png[]


== Solution: *Core Team*
[.step]
- Share multiple responsibilities
- Discusses major changes
- Reviews and approves `PR` 's
- Integrates latest into own project


== Solution: not enough!
- Team is small, busy
- Hard to enforce
- More support needed...

== Solution: *Ambassadors*
[.step]
- Interested people from projects
- Spread awareness of standard
- Call it in reviews, encourage use throughout
- Meet with Core Team 
- add `PR` 's


== Conclusion
[listing]
                           Projects
                       /              \
                      /                \

                       github/standards


== Future
[.step]
- More avenues for teaching / advocacy / adoption
- Styling can be checked by tools
  * `clang format` etc
- Techniques... harder
  * machine learning from commits?
