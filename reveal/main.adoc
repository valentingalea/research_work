== Agenda
- Intro to Coding Standards
- Splash Damage approach
- Integration into a team
- Integration across projects


== What are Coding Standards
[quote, Wikipedia]
Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language


== What are Coding Standards (cont.)
Formally adopted coding conventions become _standards_


== Examples
[.step]
- C++ ISO Standard - promotes specific styles
  * ex: all `std::` types/functions are _snake_case_
- C++ Core Guidelines
- Google style guide
- Unreal Engine 4


== Enforcing / Adoption
[.step]
- Normally presented as standalone documentation
  * ex: PDF, wiki's, etc
- People are supposed to study then apply in practice
- Usually _not_ machine readable
  * somewhat exception: Visual Studio Code Guidelines checker


== Pitfalls
[.step]
- Grow big / Hard to navigate
- Get _out-of-date_ quickly
- In separate location
  * outside production source code
- Only select few modify or improve them
- Nobody has time to read documentation! ðŸ˜›


== Splash Damage approach
[.step]
- Standards are **source code files** ðŸ“‘
  * you can break the build messing with the standard!
- Created and improved through code reviews
- A system for easy _reference_ and _searching_

== The Coding Standard
[.step]
- 2 files
  * `SplashDamageCodingStandard.h`
  * `SplashDamageCodingStandard.cpp`
- Located in the main source code
  * `ue4/Game/Source/Main/...`
- *Open Source*
  * https://github.com/splash-damage/coding-standards

== Usage
Applied via code reviews

== Usage (continued)
Takes the pressure off from feeling judgemental

== Modify and *Improve*
- The standard itself is changed though reviews sent to the whole team
- If enough up-votes â†’ the proposal gets submitted


== Unintended Consequences

== Sections Walkthrough
- More architectural than strict rule-sets
- Mostly *Unreal Engine 4* focused rather than `std::`
- Try to cater to all experience levels
  * from Juniors to Principals
